# Non-Recursive Make
This is a reference project that contains multiple libraries and programs which are all built with a single Make process.
Each sub-Makefile is included in the top-level one, which has full knowledge of what is going on.
For some history on this, read the 'Recursive Make Considered Harmful' paper - http://www.lateralt.net/files/auug97.pdf

# Notes
* All builds must be executed from the top-level
